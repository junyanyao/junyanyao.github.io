## Dataset description:
<p>This project uses the “drvisits” dataset. In 1997 Germany reformed their healthcare system to try to reduce costs. Ninety percent of the population is enrolled in this healthcare system and it is publically funded. These data track a sample of the German population before and after the reform. The outcome of interest is numvisit, the number of doctor visits in the last 3 months before the interview. Additional variables collected are: 
* age and education (in years) ; 
* married (0/1); 
* self-reported health status (badh==1 if bad health); 
* loginc is log of household income; 
* reform (0==pre; 1==post); 
* id – subject identifier. Note, there are at most two records for any one id, and in some cases there is just one.

### Step 1: Evaulate the need for transformation of variables

### Step 2: Examine the distributions of outcome variable

### Step 3: Clean some variables and generate some interactions for subsequent models

### Step 4: Perform a one sample (Paired) t-test on the difference between pre- and post- reform outcomes

### Step 5: Fit an initial MLM model

### Step 6: Evaluate models

### Step 7: Make predictions

### Step 8: Critique results
