Statisicians loves using Stata and R for Propensity Score matching research. When I was student at NYU, we have been using Stata. It has great functions such as 
```{stata}
xi: psmatch2 
```
or 
```{stata}
xi: psbal2
```
My professor Jennifer Hill, has illustrate how to do Propensity Score Matching in R in her book **Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models** 

Today, I am going to use Python to re-do my projects at school
